# Using GHA to:

>1. Setup a conda environment for Python testing.
>2. Setup a Python/pip environment for test.
>3. Build and publish documentation to gh-pages.
>4. Build, test, and publish source distribution and binary artifacts to PyPI.
>5. Build, test, cache, and publish a docker image.


# Quick review: CI-CD 1/3

- Continuous Integration (CI)
  - run tests at every code change.
  - perform schedule tests for downstream dependencies.

# Quick review: CI-CD 2/3

- Continuous Deployment (CD)
  - Publish documentation.
  - Test, and Publish tagged source distributions.
  - Build, test, and publish binary distributions.

# Quick review: CI-CD 3/3

- Most services did not integrated back with the code hosting platform.
- Awkward ways to handle secrets.


>- GHA changes that by making it easier to pass secrets and integrating with GH own services.

. . .

PS: the idea is not new. Gitlab CI already implemented most of this.

# Services are we using in the IOOS org?

- **Travis-CI**: for testing and building sites;
- **AppVeyor**: for Windows testing only;
- **AzurePipelines**: fast but not easy to integrate with GH and required a huge amount of re-writing to make old tests work.


# Enter GHA

# Building workflows

- Create a `.github/workflows` directory in your repository on GitHub;
- Create an YAML file with the instructions for your workflow
- Add Actions from the [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) or build your own.

# Warning

<section data-background-color="red">

The next slides will be terribly boring!
Even more so than the slides you've seen so far.
Viewer discretion is advised!!

I promise a cute image at the end.

# CAVEATS

>- GHA does not run when you add the first workflow file via a PR.
>- Secrets are not accessible in PRs, for safety reasons, and that can make it hard to debug some workflow.
>- People outside the org team will require someone from the team to "Approve and run" the workflow. Thanks bitcoin miners!
>- The [marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) is awesome but the curation rules are not clear yet, there may be malicious Actions! Try to get the ones with most numbers of users and/or "Veryfied" by GitHub.
